# RenameIT
A little programm to rename many files together written to practice with NW.js. It's nothing serious. 

# To Do
- The replace must work with every char in the string and not just the first
- Implement history
- Make the user choose were the numbering has to start
- Delete an arbitrary amount of char from the end to the start of the string
