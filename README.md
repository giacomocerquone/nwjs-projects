# nwjs-projects
These are projects that I've developed with NW.js

# RenameIT
A little programm to rename many files together written to practice with NW.js. It's nothing serious.

# To Do
- The replace must work with every char in the string and not just the first
- Implement history
- Make the user choose were the numbering has to start
- Delete an arbitrary amount of char from the end to the start of the string

# TranslateIT
A little program to translate easily subtitles from one language to another written to practice with NW.js. It's nothing serious.
